# About YesBot

This project is a telegram bot that interacts with users. The bot `YesBot` acts as a friendly questionnaire that engages users in series of quiz of very random questions.

My idea of this bot was to create a simple friendly and educative companion that helps users overcome boredom by sharing random knowledge.
